# My Code to the Alvin-Smart-Money-Management-Classification-Challenge

Hello this is my solution to the alvin smart money prediction challenge. I really enjoyed this challenge mainly due to the fact that it made me think a lot about feature engineering and how to extract more infomation from a limited dataset. This is my solution,hopefully it helps anyone else in feature engineering. At time of publishing this notebook there is still a few days till the competion end. Good Hunting!.
